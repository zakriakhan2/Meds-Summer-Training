# Lecture 1: Intro: Fundamentals, Transistors, Gates

## Goals of this course
- Understand the basics
- Understand the priniciples of design
- Understand the precedents
- Learn how a modern computer works
- Learn how to implement and debug complex sysstems

## The Transformation Hierarchy
- Top to Bottom Layers: Problem -> Algorithm -> Program/language -> System Software -> Software Hardware Interface -> Micro-architecture -> Logic -> Devices -> Electrons

- Narrow View: SW/HW Interface -> Micro-architecture

- Expanded View: Algorithm -> Program/language -> System Software -> Software Hardware Interface -> Micro-architecture -> Logic -> Devices

## Computer Architecture
- Science and Art of designing computing platforms.
- Includes Hardware, Interface, System software and programming model.

## What is a Computer?
- Three key components
1. Computation
2. Communication
3. Storage/Memory

## General Purpose vs Special Purpose Systems
- CPU: Flexible but not the best performance and efficiency
- GPU, FPGAs & ASICs: Efficient & high performance but difficult to program & use (inflexible)

## Transistors
#### MOS Transistor:
- By Combining
1. Conductors (**M**etal)
2. Insulators (**O**xide)
3. **S**emiconductors
- Used to realize logic gates
- Two Types: n-type & p-type

#### CMOS Transistor:
- nMOS + pMOS = CMOS
- Modern computers use CMOS technology
- n-type good at *pulling down* voltage
- p-type good at *pulling up* voltage
